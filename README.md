# Brighter / Darker Memory Leak Test


## Getting Started

Make sure you have SQL Server or SQL Server Express installed (I configured with Docker).

* Open src/BrighterDarkerMemory.sln
* Verify that the startup projects for the solution are both projects
* Run

If you open up the src/BrighterDarkerMemory.Terminal/Program.cs file you can switch between hitting an endpoint with the query processor enabled and one that uses the data context directly.
